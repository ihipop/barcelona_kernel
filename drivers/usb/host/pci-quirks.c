/*  
 *  Comment by Lewis Ma <lewis.ma@winsuntech.cn>
 *
 *  The file is provided by inventec. Minor modifications are made  
 *  for integration with Intel CEFDK PR29 kernel (2.6.39).
 *
 *  simply replace <kernel>/driver/usb/host/pci-quirks.c with this file 
 *  and recompile the kernel.
 *  
 *  This file hacks pci quirks to inject firmware into Renesas uPD720202/201
 *  firmware into the chip *BEFORE* xhci_hcd driver probes.
 *
 *  The file seems to be copied from a kernel with version newer than
 *  2.6.39, for two definitions are missed. They are just copied from the 
 *  new kernel to suppress compiler complaints.
 *  
 *  In pci init, quirk_usb_handoff_xhci() will be called. In Wilson's 
 *  code, if ROM exists is checked before injecting firmware, such check is 
 *  removed since I soldered a nor flash chip on board and it is erased.
 * 
 *  Wilson defines a macro 'renesas_dbg' as debug print switch.
